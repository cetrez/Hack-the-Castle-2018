Test several concurrent users - has been taken into account but not tested enough

Setting up server for presentation                                      #Alex

Very important!! With a working WIT, do this:
    -Implement code that is currently outcommented (messenger.py:79 and onward)
    -Remove hardcoded keyword and confidence (messenger.py:91 and onward)
    -(Test DB with more than one Questionnaire and that both can be triggered)
